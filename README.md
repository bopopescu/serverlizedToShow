# Serverlized

Serverlized is a platform as a serveice. It is designed to manage unmanged servers.

## Objective
The objective of our project is to manage the Server through a Graphical User Interface(GUI).
 
If a user want’s to manage its server and don’t have the knowledge of shell commands so the user will face difficulty to manage its server.

For getting rid of this problem we provide the user with a Graphical user interface(GUI) through which users only have to click on the buttons of their requisite technology.

We provide user a variety of technologies to install on the user’s server.

## Features

on serverlized a user can install differtent types of stacks based on his requirements like:

1. LAMP Stack : LAMP stands for Linux Apache MYSql PHP.
                Ifuser select this stack then all the above mentioned softwares will be downloaded on his server and then the user can                     manage these software by hosting a website or using the stack for other purposes
                
2. Load Balancer Stack : If the user select this stack he/she can mange the load on his/her website by using the HaProxy loadBalancer.
